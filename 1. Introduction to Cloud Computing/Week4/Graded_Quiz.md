2. Which of the following statements describes the DevOps approach and process?
   
   - Allows teams to freely build, deploy, and manage cloud native applications according to an informal, loosely defined set of guidelines.
   
   - Eliminates the need to monitor performance and availability.
   
   - A collaborative approach where business owners and development, operations, and quality assurance teams collaborate to deliver software continuously.
   
   - Eliminates the need to provision servers, build middleware, and install application code.
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - A collaborative approach where business owners and development, operations, and quality assurance teams collaborate to deliver software continuously.
     Explanation:
     - The DevOps approach applies agile and lean thinking principles to all stakeholders in an organization who develop, operate, or benefit from the business’s software systems, including customers, suppliers, and partners.
     ```

3. Which of the provided options encapsulates the complete application modernization journey?
   
   - The journey from the waterfall and agile development methodologies to DevOps.
   
   - The journey from monolithic and service-oriented architecture to microservices architecture.
   
   - The journey from physical servers and VMs to cloud infrastructure
   
   - The journey from monolithic and service-oriented architecture to microservices architecture, from physical servers and VMs to cloud infrastructure, and from the waterfall and agile methodology to DevOps.
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - The journey from monolithic and service-oriented architecture to microservices architecture, from physical servers and VMs to cloud infrastructure, and from the waterfall and agile methodology to DevOps.
     Explanation:
     - Application modernization involves the modernization of application architecture, infrastructure, and development and operations processes.
     ```

4. How would a global flower delivery company leverage the Hybrid Multicloud architecture to meet its requirement of varying capacity demands across different geographies?
   
   - By distributing their delivery service application across multiple cloud environments and providers spread across multiple geographies.
   
   - By using the automatic provisioning and de-provisioning of resources that the cloud offers.
   
   - By scaling up their on-premises architecture  
   
   - ```
     Answer:
     - By distributing their delivery service application across multiple cloud environments and providers spread across multiple geographies.
     Explanation:
     - Moving their UI and Billing capabilities over to a North American Public Cloud Data Center, while their core application continues to reside in an on-premises data center in Europe allowed the flower delivery company to scale up portions of their application in response to a surge in demand over the American holidays
     ```

5. Which of the following statements describes the DevOps approach and process?
   
   - An approach that utilizes cloud applications to monitor systems.
   
   - Eliminates the need to provision servers, build middleware, and install application code.
   
   - DevOps process is a collaborative approach that defines how people build, deploy, and manage applications in a cloud-native environment to deliver software continuously.
   
   - Eliminates the need to monitor performance and availability.
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - DevOps process is a collaborative approach that defines how people build, deploy, and manage applications in a cloud-native environment to deliver software continuously.
     Explanation:
     -  Cloud-native applications form a complex distributed system. DevOps defines the process that helps teams work in the native cloud environment.
     ```

6. Which of these scenarios is NOT a good use case for serverless architecture?
- Supporting microservices architecture

- Workloads characterized by long-running processes

- Stream processing workloads

- Microservices that can be built as stateless functions
  
  ```
  Answer:
  - * Workloads characterized by long-running processes
  Explanation:
  - For workloads characterized by long-running processes, managing a traditional server environment might be simpler and more cost-effective.
  ```
7. Which of the provided options encapsulates the complete application modernization journey?
   
   - The journey from monolithic and service-oriented architecture to microservices architecture, from physical servers and VMs to cloud infrastructure, and from waterfall and agile methodology to DevOps.
   
   - The journey from monolithic and service-oriented architecture to microservices architecture.
   
   - The journey from physical servers and VMs to cloud infrastructure.
   
   - The journey from Waterfall and Agile development methodologies to DevOps.
     
     ```
     Answer:
     -
     Explanation:
     - 
     ```

8. Fill in the blank. Microservices architecture is an approach in which a ______________ comprises many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components or services.
   
   - Cloud service
   
   - Repository application
   
   - Server
   
   - Single application
     
     ```
     Answer:
     -Single application
     Explanation:
     - These services typically have their stack running on their own containers. They communicate over APIs, event streaming, and message brokers.
     ```

9. What does a cloud native application consist of?
   
   - Executable files
   
   - Executable containers
   
   - Microservices
   
   - Application containers
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - Microservices
     Explanation:
     - These microservices are often packaged in containers, which are executable units of software in which the application code is packaged along with its libraries and dependencies so that it can be run anywhere.
     ```

10. DevOps and Cloud share a _________ relationship.
    
    - Customer
    
    - Symbiotic
    
    - Vendor
    
    - General Partnership

      ```
      Answer:
      -Symbiotic
      Explanation:
      - You don’t need an underlying compute node to connect to object storage. Instead, you can access it from anywhere using an API. 
      ```
