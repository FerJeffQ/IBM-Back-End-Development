# Emergent Trends and Practices

Learn about the use cases and challenges of emergent trends in cloud computing, such as hybrid multi-cloud, serverless computing, and microservices. Additionally, this module will teach you about the core concepts and benefits of cloud native applications, the role of DevOps in addressing some of the complexities of cloud computing, and how organizations can benefit from modernizing their applications.

__Hybrid Multi-Cloud, Microservices and Serverless__

* Hybrid multi-cloud is a cloud adoption strategy that makes it possible for public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT to interoperate seamlessly while leveraging the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.

* Microservices architecture is an approach in which an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services, leading to efficient development, maintenance, and upgradation cycles.

* Serverless computing is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks for application runtimes to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.

__Cloud Native Aplication, DevOps, and Application Modernization__

* Cloud native applications are applications that are built or refactored to work in the cloud environment. These applications, developed using DevOps methodologies, consist of microservices packaged in containers that can run in any environment—making it possible to create and update features in quick iterative cycles.

* DevOps is a collaborative approach that enables development and operations teams to continuously deliver software in quick iterative cycles while reducing overhead, duplication, and rework. DevOps’ tools, practices, and processes help tackle the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud, allowing solutions to be delivered and updated quickly and reliably.

* Application modernization helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics. Cloud computing is one of the key enablers of application modernization.
