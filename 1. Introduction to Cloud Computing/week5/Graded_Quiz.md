     ```

2. Which of the following are some best practices organizations must follow to protect their cloud resources and systems?
   
   - Adopt a shared responsibility model of active monitoring for security and compliance.
   
   - Run security monitoring tools periodically to ensure security threats and breaches are flagged
   
   - Distribute tasks, workloads, and monitoring software
   
   - Distribute tasks, workloads, and network traffic
     
     ```
     Answer:
     -Adopt a shared responsibility model of active monitoring for security and compliance.
     Explanation:
     - Operating applications and services in cloud environments demands understanding the shared accountabilities for security and compliance between the organization and the cloud provider. To ensure stability and enforcement of compliance standards and business continuity, enterprises need to set up active monitoring of all connected systems and cloud-based services.
     ```

3. Which of the following are key Identity and Access Management (IAM) components?
   
   - Protecting data while it is at rest, in motion, and in use
   
   - Encryption security practices
   
   - Embedding security through the life cycle of an application
   
   - Cloud Directory Services, Audits, and Compliance.
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - Cloud Directory Services, Audits, and Compliance.
     Explanation:
     - Cloud Directory Services manage user profiles, associated credentials, and password policies inside a cloud environment. Audit and compliance are critical services within the IAM framework. Auditors use these processes to validate implemented controls against an organization’s security policy, industry compliance, and risk policies to report deviations.
     ```

4. Which of these statements is true of cloud encryption?  
   A. Encryption ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive data.  
   B. When encrypted data is intercepted without authorization, it is unreadable and meaningless?  
   C. Encryption protects data when it is at rest, in transit, and in use in memo.  
   D. Encryption eliminates data security risks.
   
   - A, B, and C only
   
   - A and C only
   
   - A: A, B, C, and D
   
   - A, B, and D only
   
   - ```
     Answer:
     - A, B, and C only
     Explanation:
     - Encryption does not eliminate data security risk—it separates the security risk from the data itself by moving security to the encryption keys.
     ```

5. Identify some of the standard cloud monitoring best practices from the provided options.
   
   - Authenticate users attempting to access their cloud resources.
   
   - Encrypt data before it is sent to the cloud.
   
   - Encrypt data on a physical storage device.
   
   - Leverage end-user experience monitoring solutions to capture the performance of an application from the point of view of its end users and track the usage and cost of your cloud resources and services.
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - Leverage end-user experience monitoring solutions to capture the performance of an application from the point of view of its end users and track the usage and cost of your cloud resources and services.
     Explanation:
     -  End-user experience monitoring solutions monitor user journeys to track parameters such as application response time and frequency of use. Organizations can leverage cloud monitoring tools to monitor and optimize the usage of their cloud resources and services.
     ```

6. What are some of the monitoring tools that help you to gain insights about your posture, compliance, and threats?
- Hypervisors

- Flow logs from the network and security events

- Flow logs and hypervisors

- Data encryption
  
  ```
  Answer:
  - Flow logs from the network and security events
  Explanation:
  -  Flow logs help to monitor information about how the network resources are operating. Security events indicate when a security policy may have been violated.
  ```
7. What are some of the benefits of using access groups?
   
   - The use of access groups helps to reduce the number of policies in an account. Access groups provide a more streamlined way to assign access rights.
   
   - Access groups help increase the number of policies of an account.
   
   - Access groups create an additional level of authentication for application users.
   
   - Access groups define the users, the resources to which access is granted, and the permission level each user has on these resources.
     
     ```
     Answer:
     -The use of access groups helps to reduce the number of policies in an account. Access groups provide a more streamlined way to assign access rights.
     Explanation:
     - Access policies defined at a group level mean lesser access policies, leading to increased performance. Access groups make it possible to assign the same access to all entities within group 76.
     ```

8. Identify the two main parts of an encryption system from the provided options.
   
   - Server-side encryption
   
   - Client-side encryption
   
   - Physical encryption device
   
   - The encryption algorithm and decryption key
     
     ```
     Answer:
     -The encryption algorithm and decryption key
     Explanation:
     - The encryption algorithm defines the rules by which data is scrambled to become illegible. The decryption key defines how the encrypted data will be transformed back to legible data.
     ```

9. What are some of the benefits that cloud monitoring solutions offer?
   
   - Prevent unauthorized users from accessing the systems
   
   - Enhanced security to user accounts
   
   - Accelerate the diagnosis and resolution of performance incidents and provide proactive notifications of abnormal or unusual situations.
   
   - Troubleshoot applications and infrastructure
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - Accelerate the diagnosis and resolution of performance incidents and provide proactive notifications of abnormal or unusual situations.
     Explanation:
     - Cloud monitoring solutions are designed to give organizations complete visibility and control over the performance of their cloud resources. Cloud monitoring solutions help mitigate the impact of abnormal situations by providing proactive notifications.
     ```

10. The Weather Company migrated its weather web property to a secure, scalable, and global architecture in the IBM Cloud. What benefits did they realize as a result of this migration?
    
    - Faster development and release of new apps and digital self-service tools to customers
    
    - Harness local data centers to minimize latency for users and optimize their systems for elasticity in handling extreme spikes in demand.
    
    - Increase asset availability and overall equipment effectiveness
    
    - Increase development and increased latency

      Answer:
      -Harness local data centers to minimize latency for users and optimize their systems for elasticity in handling extreme spikes in demand.
      Explanation:
      - Since the weather is a hyper-local phenomenon, the scalability of the web platform needs to be localized, which is made possible with cloud technologies. The Weather Company leveraged the cloud’s scalability to handle massive, short-notice peak workloads.
