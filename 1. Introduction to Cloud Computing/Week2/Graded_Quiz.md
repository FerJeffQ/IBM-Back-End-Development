# Cloud Computing Models: Graded Quiz

1. In which cloud service model does the service provider manage the application data along with the infrastructure and platform resources?
   
   - PaaS
   
   - IaaS
   
   - SaaS
   
   - CaaS
     
     ```
     Answer:
     SaaS
     
     Explanation:
     In the SaaS model, in addition to the infrastructure and the platform resources, the provider also hosts and manages the applications and data.
     ```

2. In which IaaS cloud environment can the customers deploy their middleware and install applications?
   
   - Virtual Machines
   
   - Blockchain
   
   - IoT
   
   - AI
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - Virtual Machines
     Explanation:
     The virtual machines (VMs) come pre-installed on the customer’s choice of operating system. The customers can then deploy middleware, install applications, and run workloads on these VMs.
     ```

3. What is one of the concerns in cloud infrastructure configuration and management?
   
   - Scaling infrastructure up and down as demand fluctuates
   
   - Business continuity and disaster recovery
   
   - Dependency on a third party for workload availability and performance
   
   - Solving complex problems involving millions of variables and calculations
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - Dependency on a third party for workload availability and performance
     Explanation:
      In IaaS, there are some concerns regarding the lack of transparency in the cloud infrastructure’s configuration and management and dependency on a third party for workload availability and performance.
     ```

4. What is the responsibility of a user in the PaaS model?
   
   - Business process management systems
   
   - Workload management
   
   - Database management systems
   
   - Application code and its maintenance
     
     ```
     Answer:
     Application code and its maintenance
     Explanation:
     In the PaaS model, while the provider takes responsibility for the application infrastructure, the user is responsible for the application code and its maintenance.
     ```

5. Which capability in the PaaS model eliminates the need for the integration of disparate components?
   
   - Runtime environment
   
   - APIs for services
   
   - Rapid deployment mechanisms
   
   - Rapid deployment mechanisms
     
     ```
     Answer:
     - APIs for services
     Explanation:
     Oracle Data Cloud provides one of the largest cloud-based data management platforms helping customers personalize their online, offline, and mobile marketing campaigns for targeted audiences.
     ```

6. Which is a characteristic of the SaaS model?
- Infrastructure and code are maintained by the users

- Users can see only their own application

- Applications reside on a remote cloud network

- Services are free for the users on the SaaS cloud
  
  ```
  Answer:
  Applications reside on a remote cloud network
  Explanation:
  Applications reside on a remote cloud network, and users use these applications without having to maintain and update the infrastructure.
  ```
7. What is the users’ role in a public cloud?
   
   - Users maintain the platform that runs their application
   
   - Users don’t own the servers their applications run on
   
   - Users can manage the operations of the servers
   
   - Users own the storage their data consumes
     
     ```
     Answer:
     Users don’t own the servers their applications run on
     Explanation:
     Users don’t own the servers their applications run on or storage their data consumes, manage the operations of the servers, or even determine how the platforms are maintained.
     ```

8. What is a feature of a private cloud?
   
   - Application portability
   
   - Uncontrolled access
   
   - Use of external computing resources
   
   - Limited security
     
     ```
     Answer:
     * Application portability
     Explanation:
     Using the private cloud gives organizations the flexibility to build applications anywhere and move them anywhere without compromising security and compliance in the process.
     ```

9. If an organization needs to run a highly sensitive and mission-critical application with unpredictable performance and capacity requirements, which of the following models would best meet its requirements?
   
   - Private Cloud
   
   - On-premise Data Centers
   
   - Hybrid Cloud
   
   - Public Cloud
     
     ```
     Answer:
     Hybrid Cloud
     Explanation:
     With a Hybrid Cloud, organizations can choose to run their mission-critical applications on the private cloud while leveraging additional public cloud capacity to accommodate spikes in demand for their application.
     ```

10. What do you mean by “cloud bursting”?
    
    - You can move applications and data between on-premises and cloud systems
    
    - You can leverage public cloud instances for a period of time but return to the private cloud when the surge is met
    
    - You can incrementally modernize your core business systems
    
    - You can spin-up environments using pay-as-you-go in the public cloud
      
      ```
      Answer:
      You can leverage public cloud instances for a period of time but return to the private cloud when the surge is met
      Explanation:
      With proper integration and orchestration between the public and private clouds, you can leverage both clouds for the same workload. You can leverage additional public cloud capacity to accommodate a spike in demand for a private cloud application.
      ```
